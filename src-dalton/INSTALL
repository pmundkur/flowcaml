  	     Installing the Dalton Library on a Unix machine



--------------------------------------------------------------------------
PREREQUISITES

* The Objective Caml system, version 3.06 or greater
  (available at http://caml.inria.fr/)

* GNU Make



--------------------------------------------------------------------------
INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

1- Go to the source directory of the library, i.e. the directory
   src-dalton/ of the distribution:

        cd src-dalton



2- Configure the system.  From the source directory, do:

        ./configure

The "configure" script accepts the following option:

-libdir=<dir>
	Directory where the library will be installed
	(by default, the subdirectory dalton of the ocaml library
	directory, e.g. /usr/local/lib/ocaml/dalton)

--disable-assert
	Disable run-time assertion checks in source code



2- Compile.  From the source directory, do:

        make world

This compiles the bytecode and native (if available) object files of
the library.



3- You can now install the library.  This will create the installation
   directory (as specified during configuration) and copy into it
   object and interface files of the library.  From the source
   directory, become superuser and do:

        umask 022       # make sure to give read & execute permission to all
        make install



4- Installation is complete.  You can restore the source tree to its
   original content by

       make clean

   If you wish to uninstall the library, just delete the directory in
   which you installed it.
