			 Flow Caml emacs mode

The flowcaml.el file defines a flowcaml-mode for emacs, for editing
Flow Caml programs, as well as running a toplevel.  This mode is a
slight adaptation of the caml-mode, which must be already installed on
your system.

To use it, just put the file in your path, and add the following
three lines in your .emacs.

    (setq auto-mode-alist
          (cons '("\\.fml[i]?$" . flowcaml-mode) auto-mode-alist))
    (autoload 'flowcaml-mode "flowcaml" "Major mode for Flow Caml" t)

By default, the mode enables font-lock highlighting of source code.
To disable it, add in your .emacs

    (setq flowcaml-font-lock nil)

To install the mode itself, edit the Makefile and do

    % make install
