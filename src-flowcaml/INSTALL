  		  Installing Flow Caml on a Unix machine



--------------------------------------------------------------------------
PREREQUISITES

* The Objective Caml system, version 3.08 or greater
  (available at http://caml.inria.fr/)

* GNU Make

* A minor feature of Flow Caml requires the GraphViz tools to be
  installed.  They can be download at the following adresses:

      http://www.graphviz.org/
      http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/graphviz/

  However, the configure script automatically detects their presence,
  and the system should run properly even if they are not found.

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

1- Go to the source directory of the system, i.e. the directory
   src-flowcaml/ of the distribution:

        cd src-flowcaml



2- Configure the system.  From the source directory, do:

        ./configure

The "configure" script accepts the following option:

-bindir=<dir>
	Directory where the binaries will be installed
	(by default, /usr/local/bin)

-libdir=<dir>
	Directory where the standard library will be installed
	(by default, /usr/local/lib/flowcaml)

-prefix=<dir>
        Set bindir and libdir to <dir>/bin and <dir>/lib/flowcaml

-with-runlib=<dir>
	Directory where the runtime library will be installed
	(by default, {ocaml-libdir}/flowcamlrun

--disable-assert
	Disable run-time assertion checks in source code



2- Compile.  From the source directory, do:

        make world

This first builds the Flow Caml interactive toplevel and batch
compilers.  Then it uses the latter to build the Flow Caml standard library



3- You can now install the system.  This will create the following
commands (in the binary directory selected during autoconfiguration):

	 flowcaml	the interactive toplevel
	 flowcamlc	the batch compiler
	 flowcamldep	the dependencies generator
	 flowcamlmerge	the compilation units merger

From the source directory, become superuser and do:

        umask 022       # make sure to give read & execute permission to all
        make install



4- Installation is complete.  You can restore the source tree to its
   original content by

       make clean

   If you wish to uninstall Flow Caml from your system, you can do

       make uninstall
